# Summary

Go-HEP provides tools to interface with CERN's ROOT [@ROOT] software
framework and carry analyses or data acquisition from within the Go [@Go]
programming language.

Go-HEP exposes libraries to read and write common High Energy Physics (HEP)
file formats (HepMC [@HepMC], LHEF [@LHEF], SLHA [@SLHA]) but, at the
moment, only read interoperability is achieved with ROOT file format.
Go-HEP also provides tools to carry statistical analyses in the form of
1-dim and 2-dim histograms, 1-dim and 2-dim scatters and n-tuples.
Go-HEP can also graphically represent these results, leveraging the
Gonum [@Gonum] plotting library.

# Motivations

Writing analyses in HEP involves many steps and one needs a few tools to
successfully carry out such an endeavour.
But - at minima - one needs to be able to read (and possibly write) ROOT files
to be able to interoperate with the rest of the HEP community or to insert
one's work into an already existing analysis pipeline.

Go-HEP provides this necessary interoperability layer, in the Go programming
language.
This allows physicists to leverage the great concurrency primitives of Go,
together with the surrounding tooling and software engineering ecosystem of Go,
to implement physics analyses.

## Packages

In this section, we list the packages that Go-HEP provides together with a
short description.

### `go-hep/groot`

`go-hep/groot` provides read access to data stored in ROOT files.
`groot` is a pure-Go implementation of the ROOT file format, reimplementing
from scratch the decoding and interpretation of ROOT's low-level file blocks
(`TDirectory`, `TKey`, `TBuffer` and `TFile`) together with file metadata,
such as `TStreamerInfo` and `TStreamerElement` that allow to serialize and
deserialize C++ class' instances.
1- and 2-dimensional histograms (`TH1x` and `TH2x`) can be extracted from
ROOT files using `groot`, as well as n-tuple data (`TTree`).
Go-HEP can also convert ROOT histograms into YODA's [@YODA] or Go-HEP's native
format.

`go-hep/groot` is the gateway to the wealth of data generated, simulated and
acquired by LHC experiments.

Right now, `go-hep/groot` can only read ROOT data.
Work is in progress to also create ROOT-compatible data files.

### `go-hep/fmom`

The `go-hep/fmom` package provides different representations of Lorentz vectors
(4-components vectors that represent the momentum and energy of particles.)
`go-hep/fmom` currently implements the `(px,py,pz,e)`, `(e,eta,phi,m)`,
`(inv-pt, cot-theta, phi, m)` and `(pt, eta, phi, m)` Lorentz vector
representations and operations that apply on these 4-vectors.

### `go-hep/hbook` and `go-hep/hbook/ntup`

`go-hep/hbook` provides 1- and 2-dimensional histograms, 1-dim profiles and
2-dim scatters, for the statistical representation of variables.
Notably, histograms allow to retrieve the mean, standard deviation,
standard error and the sum of weights of a given variable.

`go-hep/hbook/ntup` provides a way to create, open and iterate over n-tuple
data: rows of records.
`ntup` can be seen as a database of HEP event data.
Indeed, `ntup` is built on Go's `database/sql` package that allows to interact
with various databases via plugins (`SQLite`, `MySQL`, ...)
`go-hep/hbook/ntup/ntupcsv` is a convenience package that allows to load a `CSV`
file in memory and work on it as a database.

### `go-hep/hepmc`, `go-hep/hepevt`, `go-hep/heppdt`, `go-hep/lhef` and `go-hep/slha`

`go-hep/hepmc` and `go-hep/hepevt` are packages used to represent HEP event
interactions: they carry informations about a fundamental event interaction
(incoming partons) and the decay chains, down to the hadronization and stable
final particles.
`hepevt` is the implementation of the old `FORTRAN` standard, while `hepmc` is
the new `C++` representation.
`hepmc` files are usually the result of a Monte-Carlo generator where the
simulation of physics processes (branching ratios, hadronization, ...) has been
implemented.
Go-HEP doesn't currently provide Monte-Carlo generators.

`heppdt` provides access to the HEP particle data table: a catalog of
informations (mass, width, ...) about all particles of the Standard Model (and
beyond the Standard Model.)

`lhef` [@LHEF] and `slha` [@SLHA] are exchange format files for Monte-Carlo
generators.

### `go-hep/fwk`

`fwk` is a pure-Go, concurrent implementation of a typical HEP control
framework.
Control frameworks are used in HEP to collect the acquired data from _e.g._ the
LHC experiments and channel it through the various reconstruction algorithms.
Control frameworks are the angular stone of HEP experiments, allowing to
organize and schedule the algorithms that identify and reconstruct electrons,
muons, etc.. from electronic signals coming from the detectors.

`go-hep/fwk` leverages the concurrency primitives of Go to provide an easy
to use toolkit, ready to harness the power of multicore machines.
`go-hep/fwk` parallelizes work at the event level, allowing to work on multiple
events at a time.
`go-hep/fwk` also parallelizes work at the sub-event level, scheduling in
parallel algorithms that don't need inputs from each other.
`go-hep/fwk` doesn't provide extra tools to perform parallel work at the
sub-algorithm level, leaving the algorithms' implementors with all the tools
from the Go language (_e.g._ `channels`, `goroutines` and `sync.Wait` or
`golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`.)

### `go-hep/fads`

`fads` is a Fast Detector Simulation toolkit.
It uses `fwk` to provide a concurrency-friendly toolkit that performs so-called
fast-simulation of detectors, with components for:

- particles' isolation
- b-tagging, tau-tagging
- calorimetry simulation
- energy scaling and energy smearing
- momentum smearing
- particles propagation in a magnetic field
- jets finding (using `go-hep/fastjet`)

`go-hep/fads` is a pure-Go reimplementation of a `C++` program called Delphes [@Delphes].
`go-hep/fastjet` is a pure-Go reimplementation of a `C++` library called FastJet [@FastJet].

### `go-hep/lcio`, `go-hep/sio` and `go-hep/rio`

`lcio` implements read/write access to the binary file format developed for
the Linear Collider community.
It is a pure-Go reimplementation of a C++ library of the same name [@LCIO].
`sio` is the low-level access to this binary file format, `lcio` implements
the event data model that has been used by the LC community.

`go-hep/rio` is a fork of `lcio` to provide 64b indexing and thus support >4Gb files.

### `go-hep/hplot`

`hplot` is a package providing building blocks for creating plots.
It leverages the Gonum [@Gonum] plotting package to create HEP oriented plots,
using `go-hep/hbook` data as input.
`hplot` can generate publication quality plots in PNG, SVG, PDF or EPS formats.
`hplot` also provides a work-in-progress interactive shell with an OpenGL backend
(on Linux or macOS; Windows will use the `win32` API) to display plots.

## Commands

Go-HEP also provides a few commands that use Go-HEP packages.

### `cmd/root2npy`

The command `root2npy` uses the `go-hep/groot` package to convert n-tuple data
stored in ROOT files into NumPy [@NPyFormat] array data files.
This command does not need any ROOT installation nor any NumPy installation:
everything has been implemented in pure-Go from first principles.
This is useful to quickly convert data and interoperate with analyses'
pipelines that are mostly python based.

### `cmd/root2yoda`

The `root2yoda` command converts ROOT files containing histogram values into
their YODA equivalent, saved in a YODA ASCII file.

### `go-hep/groot/cmd/root-ls` and `root-srv`

The `root-ls` command allows to quickly inspect and display the content of a
ROOT file from the shell.

The `root-srv` command launches a local web server that can be used to
inspect graphically ROOT files, displaying histograms and n-tuple data.
